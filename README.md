# superregenerative_radio

Super-regenerative radio for receiving signals in the range of 20 meters. The circuit board has been reduced, which can increase the maximum operating frequency.

A rather loud reception of stations of distant stations was noted when using an amplifier on a TDA2030A chip.

The frequency range depends on the specifically installed components that were measured during operation. The coil was used with 6-15 turns on a diameter of 10 mm, and the capacitor used a standard 40-240 picofarad.

Using a converter on a chip, it was possible to receive an FM station of 80-108 MHz, although the quality of such a reception is naturally lower.
